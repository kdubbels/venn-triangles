                <h2>New South Wales</h2>
                <p>
                    New South Wales (abbreviated as NSW) is Australia’s oldest and most populous state, located in the south-east of the
                    country, north of Victoria and south of Queensland. It was founded in 1788 and originally comprised much of the
                    Australian mainland, as well as Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. New Zealand was not initially part of the colony,
                    although when Britain annexed New Zealand in 1840 it was briefly a part of New South Wales. During the 19th century
                    large areas were successively separated to form the British colonies of Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria,
                    Queensland, and New Zealand.

                <h2>Victoria</h2>
                <p>
                    Victoria is a state located in the south-eastern corner of Australia. It is the smallest mainland state in area but
                    the most densely populated and urbanised. Prior to European settlement, some 30,000 Indigenous Australians lived in
                    the area now occupied by the state. By contrast, over five million people now inhabit the region. European settlement
                    in Victoria began in the 1830s as a farming community. Victoria is the second most populous Australian state, after New South Wales, with
                    an estimated population of 5,205,200 as of June 2007. Melbourne is Victoria’s capital and largest city, with more
                    than 70% of all Victorians living there.

                <h2>Western Australia</h2>
                <p>
                    Western Australia is a state occupying the entire western third of the Australian continent. The nation’s largest
                    state and the second largest sub-national entity in the world, it has 2.1 million inhabitants (10% of the national
                    total), 85% of whom live in the south-west corner of the state. The people of Western Australia are often
                    colloquially referred to as sand-gropers, the common name of an insect found on sand dunes around Perth.

                <p>
                    South Australia is a state of Australia in the southern central part of the country. It covers some of the most arid
                    parts of the continent; with a total land area of 983,482 square kilometres, it is the fourth largest
                    of Australia’s six states and two territories. It is bordered to the west by Western Australia, to the north by the
                    Northern Territory and Queensland, to the east by Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, and along the south by
                    the Great Australian Bight and the Southern Ocean. With nearly 1.6 million people, the state comprises less than
                    10% of the Australian population and ranks fifth in population among the states and territories.
